# Design Patterns - Typescript :book:

This repository is to study and practice some dessign patterns using typescipt. :rocket:
Each orphan branch contains the explication ans some code examples for each design pattern.

## Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- Factory Method
  * Creates an instance of several derived classes
- Abstract Factory
  * Creates an instance of several families of classes
- Builder
  * Separates object construction from its representation
- Prototype
  * A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- Singleton
  * A class of which only a single instance can exist

## Structural Design Patterns
- Decorator
  * Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- Adapter
  * Match interfaces of different classes
- Facade
  * A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- Bridge
  * Separates an object's interface from its implementation
- Composite 
  * A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- Flyweight
  * A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- Proxy 
  * An object representing another object


## Behavioral Design Patterns
- Chain of Responsability
  * A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- Command
  * Encapsulate a command request as an object
- Iterator
  * Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- Mediator
  * Defines simplified communication between classes
- Memento
  * Capture and restore an object's internal state
- Observer
  * A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- State
  * Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- Strategy
  * Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- Template Method
  * Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- Visitor
  * Defines a new operation to a class without change
